Welcome to my Tower Defense Game project! This project served as a practical exploration of Unity's "Scriptable Objects" for me. With this game, I've created a versatile framework that lays the foundation for developing various types of Tower Defense Games. You have the freedom to define custom enemies, waves, and even modify essential game parameters such as player health and starting money.
